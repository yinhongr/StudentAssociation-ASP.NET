            Chinese Scneries Agency establish in 2002, the general headquarters is in Beijing.
            In the first few years, we were a small agency that only served for the customer in
            China. And the main service is establishing a tour group and show them around the
            Chinese Sceneries. 
            <br /><br />
            As the company became larger and larger, the customers we served expanded from 
            the people in China to the global customers. And the product range became wider and wider, 
            including tour operation, business house and so on.
            <br /><br />
            Our aim is to give our customers a personal and friendly service that help them decide 
            where they want to go, when they want to go, and help them to make a travel plan. 
            Small enough to care for our customers on a personal level, we are also big enough 
            to negotiate with the airlines for some of the lowest fares you will find anywhere
            in the industry. The travel plan will be highly suitable to individuals, we will 
            try our best to give you a very comfortable tour in China!
            <br /><br />
